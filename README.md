# Project Title

In this project, I used Python and OpenCV to find lane lines in the road images. 
The following techniques are used:

•	Color Selection

•	Canny Edge Detection

•	Region of Interest Selection

•	Hough Transform Line Detection

Finally, I applied all the techniques to process video clips to find lane lines in them.
